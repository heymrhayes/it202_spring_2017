            <p class="lab-intro">
                In this project, you'll demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas element by making a simple scrolling game.
            </p>
            <p class="lab-intro">
                Your file should be <code>/projects/project3.html</code>.  Your game should have the following features:</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>A "Welcome" screen with a game name and instructions. When the user clicks the canvas, the game displays and starts.</li>
                    <li>A player character on the left side of the screen that moves only vertically and which the player controls using the up/down arrow keys;</li>
                    <li>"Harm" characters which move from right to left and which, upon collision with the player, result in a loss the player's lives;</li>
                    <li>"Benefit" characters which also move from right to left and which, upon collision with the player, adds points to the score;</li>
                    <li>Display of lives left and score on the top of the screen;</li>
                    <li>A "Game Over" screen when the player has used their last life.</li>
                    <li>One type of character (player, harm or benefit) must be an image.</li>
                </ol>
   
        </div>
        <div class="lab lab-section lab-instructions">
            <h2>Hints/Suggestions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To start, get a single item to move from right to left across your canvas.</li>
                <li>When it gets to the left edge, move it back to right side and set it's y position randomly.</li>
                <li>Create an array of these items, using a constructor to create each one; use a parameter for <strong>type</strong> of character (harm or benefit.)</li>
                
                <li>Get a player character to move up and down in response to arrow keys.</li>
                <li>Create and display (with labels) variables for score and lives left.</li>
                <li>Get collision testing working;  upon collision, check the type of the object that collided, and update the variables accordingly.</li>
                <li>Upon collision, display a screen with a relevant message and continue the game when the user clicks the canvas.</li>
                <li>When the lives left are negative, display a Game Over message.</li>
                
                <li>Get started early.</li>
                <li>Ask questions on Piazza (I don't expect you to have all the answers.)</li>
                <li>Test step by step.</li>
               
                <li>Save and push to your GitHub repo.</li>
             </ol>

          <h2>Evaluation</h2>

          <p>25% for message screens (start, collision, game over)</p>

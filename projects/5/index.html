        <div class="lab-intro">
            <p class="lab-intro">
                In this project, you'll have the experience of building a product <em>for</em> someone that meets their needs.  The purpose is for you to go through the <em>process</em>:  determining requirements, creating the first version, testing and getting feedback from the client, then revising and delivering.  The amazingness of the app is not what this project is about.  </p> 
            <p class="lab-intro">
                Your file should be <code>/projects/project5.html</code>.  Your app should have the following features:</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Three screens with different content.  The content can be static (pictures of you, information they need to retrieve frequently, etc.) but the data should be different on each screen. (You can certainly choose to pull and present data from the world, but that's not necessary.);</li>
                    <li>Navigation that lets the user easily get to each screen.</li>
                    <li>Uses the MDLite framework.  Take a look at the <strong>layout</strong> components;  they will handle most of the app for you.</li>
                    <li>Includes a manifest and the meta tags necessary for it to be loaded on the device as an app (refer to the <strong>airhorner</strong> lab);</li>
                    <li>An additional screen ("About") with information about the developer.</li>

                </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="lab lab-section lab-instructions">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a client - a relative or friend.</li>
                <li>Ask them what information they look up frequently. If you know the person well, you may have a good idea of what they would find useful.</li>
                <li>Choose an MDLite layout component (not template) and enter content.</li> 
                <li>Create a manifest.json file and add the meta tags necessary.</li> 
                <li><strong>Test with the client.</strong> Document the feedback you get.</li> 
                <li>Revise and test your app, repeating as needed.</li>
                <li>Deliver.</li>
            </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="lab  lab-section lab-resources">
          <h2>Evaluation</h2>
          <p>40% for functionality (does it function, not "is it amazing"</p>
          <p>30% for visual appearance and completeness</p>
          <p>30% for documented testing and feedback</p>
          
          <p>Again, these can be screens of static content, but they should serve a purpose for the client.</p>

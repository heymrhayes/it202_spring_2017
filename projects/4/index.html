            <p class="lab-intro">
                In this project, you'll refresh your skills in building and editing HTML.  You'll create a page that will serve as the front-end of your GitHub repo and will contain descriptions and links for your projects.  
            <p class="lab-intro">
                This file will <strong>not</strong> live in the projects folder but will instead be at the top level of your repo with the name <code>index.html</code>; the other pages can also live at the top level. Your page should have the following features:</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Uses the Material Design Lite <em>Portfolio</em> template, available at <a href="https://getmdl.io/templates/index.html">https://getmdl.io/templates/index.html</a> (if you find some other template that you'd much rather use, let me know);</li>
                    <li>Includes the Portfolio and About pages (other pages are optional)</li>
                    <li>Includes cards for your projects and labs, with links to the projects, titles, descriptions of each and an image, even if it's a screen grab of your project.</li>
                    <li>The About section should include your name, some description of your background, your educational focus, your technical skills and career goals.  You do <em>not</em> have to include personal contact information.</li>
                </ol>
            <p class="lab-intro">You will also create a simple file at<code>projects/4/index.html</code> which will have a link to this new home page for your repo.

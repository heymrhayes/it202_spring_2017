                In this project, you'll demonstrate your ability to accept user input, make AJAX calls and update the DOM with both text and a visualization.
            </p>
            <p class="lab-intro">You'll pull data on requests that are "open" from the City's "311 Service Requests - Pot Holes Reported" dataset at <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Pot-Holes-Reported/7as2-ds3y">https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Pot-Holes-Reported/7as2-ds3y</a>.</p>

                Your page will include the following display elements:            </p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>A table with the total number of potholes by community area,</li>
                    <li>a piechart of that data (ordered by number of open requests), and </li>
                    <li>a heatmap of the open pothole requests.</li>
                </ol>

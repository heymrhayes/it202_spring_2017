        <div class="lab-intro">
            <p class="lab-intro">
                In this project, you'll demonstrate your ability to combine a number of the languages, tools and features we've covered this semester into a usable app.
            </p>
            <p class="lab-intro">
                My intent is that you have a project you can be proud of and that says something about your capabilities to a potential employer and/or to other developers.  And in my ideal world, you create an app that is actually useful to you and/or others.
            </p>

        <div class="lab lab-section lab-instructions">
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>Your app must include the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It must work well on a mobile device.</li>
                <li>It must be a Single Page App (not a set of pages.)</li>
                <li>It must have at least 3 screens, plus an About screen.</li>
                <li>It must have clear navigation.</li>
                <li>It must use the MDLite framework.</li>
                <li>It must use the jQuery library.</li>
                <li>It must be installable on the phone as an app (manifest.json and the required meta tags)</li>
                <li>It must utilize a Service Worker and the Cache Storage API to cache and deliver assets.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>(Note that all of the above can be accomplished without knowing what data you'll use. In fact, a template with all those features would be good to have as a starting point for lots of apps you might build.)</strong>
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>It must utilize data pulled from an API; at least one data call must be in response to user action (e.g, a search or selection.)</li>
                <li>It must utilize the Indexed DB API (via a wrapper like Dexie.js) to store and retrieve  data.</li>
                <li>It must include some visualization (map, chart, something).</li>
                <li>It must include one or more images.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the app itself, your project must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Include an early review with me (can be done via email if we can't find a meeting time);</li>
                <li>Show evidence of planning (a document or the use of issues in GitHub);</li>
                <li>Include a document with the results of some user testing;</li>
                <li>Use good naming conventions for variables, functions, etc in your code;</li>
                <li>Use good commenting in your code;</li>
                <li>Provide commented attribution for code you found elsewhere (with url of the source);</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I reserve the right to add one or two things depending on what additional topics we cover.</p>

        <div class="lab lab-section lab-resources">
            <h2>So what might this look like?</h2>
            <p>You use apps all the time;  take a look at a few of them and see how they function.  How many screens?  What's on each one?  </p>
            <p>Your app could retrieve, display and manipulate data; it could be a game;  it could allow creation of data; it could aggregate data from a variety of sources; it could be a drawing app (using the canvas element); or something much more creative than I can imagine. </p>
            
            <p>You've been building up to this all semester, and this project requires that you assemble capabilities from prior projects and labs into a coherent whole.</p>
            <p>Planning will be important to completing the project on time and with minimal stress, and you can get a start on large chunks of the project even if you haven't decided on the data you'll be working with.  (If you don't have any ideas, I can provide a couple.)</p>

      <div class="lab lab-section lab-instructions">
          <h2>Evaluation</h2>
          <p>I will provide some numbers on the individual items, but this should look good and function well.</p>

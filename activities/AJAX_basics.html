             <h2>Instructions</h2>
             <h3>Part 1 - Learning about the City of Chicago Data API</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The City of Chicago - like many government, business, NGO and not-for-profit entities - makes data available through an API.  When working with a new API, we need to read the documentation and understand <ol type="a">
                        <li>how to structure the request URL, and</li>
                        <li>how the returned data is structured.</li>
                    </ol>
                    The City's data portal is at <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org">https://data.cityofchicago.org/</a>.  Open that page in a new tab.
                </li>
                <li>After exploring the information on the home page, search for the "Food Inspections" dataset.  Find the result with the "Dataset" icon, and open the dataset.</li>
                <li>The City uses software from Socrata (<a href="https://socrata.com/">https://socrata.com/</a>) to make city data available to the public, and the interface allows users to access the data in a variety of ways.  We're interested in the API access, so after exploring the interface, click the light blue "Export" button.
                </li>
                <li>Note that there are multiple options for exporting the data.  Expand the "SODA API" section, and note the following important items:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>The API Endpoint,</li>
                        <li>the list of field names, and</li>
                        <li>the documentation link.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Open the documentation.
                </li>
                <li>The documentation page provides information applicable to all Socrata API datasets as well as information specific to this dataset.  You should read through the page when you have time, but for now, scroll down to the field information, and expand the "zip" field information.</li>
                <li>Read the "Simple Filters" section, copy the URL, and open it in a new tab.  This is the data that will be returned when we make an AJAX call to that URL. Note how we can filter the data by passing URL parameters with fieldnames and values.  <br><br>(If you know SQL, feel free to look at the "Query options" section to see how to do much more complex requests - even aggregate functions - by passing SQL clauses as URL parameters.)</li>
                <li>
                    Here's an AJAX example you can run in the console (because this page includes the jQuery library.)  Note that we're passing multiple URL parameters as an object that is the value of the <strong>data</strong> property.
                    <br>
                    <code><pre>
                    $.ajax({
                        url: "https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/cwig-ma7x.json",
                        type: "GET",
                        data: {
                          "$limit" : 50,
                          "zip" : 60618
                        }
                    })
                    .done(function(data){
                      alert("Retrieved " + data.length + " records from the dataset!");
                      console.log(data);
                    });    
                        
                        
                        
                    </pre></code>
                    
                    The $.ajax method converts the returned text to a JavaScript object and exposes that object to the <strong>done</strong> handler;  you'll usually see it with the parameter name "data."<br><br>
                    Since we logged "data" to the console, we can see the object and explore it. 
                </li>
                <li>
                     Try adding an additional filter value.
                </li>
             </ol>
             
             <h3>Part 2 - Looping through the data</h3> 
             <ol>
                 <li>Since we have access to that data in our script, we're can do more than log the entire object; let's loop through the data.
                     <br><br>
                     Let's add an $.each loop to the "done" event. What are we looping through?  The "data" parameter passed to callback function. For each record, log the "dba_name" to the console.  Paste  the following inside the anonymous callback function for the "done" event.
                     <code><pre>
                     $.each(data, function (idx, val) {
                         console.log(val.dba_name);
                     });
                     </pre></code>
                 </li>                 
             </ol>
            <h3>Part 3 - Update the DOM</h3> 
             <ol>
                 <li>Finally, let's use the jQuery <strong>.append</strong> function to update the DOM.  Our initial output will be simple, but we need only make better choices regarding html and css to have a better layout.
                     
                     Replace the <code>console.log</code> statement inside the loop with <br>
                     <code>$("body").append(val.dba_name + "<br>");</code>
                 
                 </li>
                 <li>Try displaying additional data elements, concatenating them with some HTML tags.</li>
             </ol>

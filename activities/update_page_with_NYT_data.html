             <h2>Instructions</h2>
             <h3>Part 1 - Examining an object</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The JavaScript at the bottom of the page represents an array of NYT articles;  this is a sample from the NYT Article Search API.</li>
                <li>Open the JavaScript console, copy the script below, and paste and execute it in the console.</li>
                <li>There is no value returned in response to creating a variable, which is why "undefined" is displayed, but you (most likely) successfully created the variable.   Type the variable name at the prompt, and hit enter.
                </li>
                <li>Note the display in the console, indicating that <strong>docs</strong> is an object. Click the expansion arrow. </li>
                <li>Note that <strong>docs</strong> is an array;  the display shows the array's contents, along with its one property (<strong>length</strong>) and the JavaScript methods for an array object (under the <strong>__proto__</strong> array.)  </li>
                <li>Expand <strong>docs[0]</strong> to see the structure of the first article record;  note that it contains not only strings, numbers and booleans but also arrays and objects, and that those may contain additional complex objects.</li>
                <li>
                    When working with JSON objects, we need to understand the structure of the data so that we can determine how to programmatically access the items we want.  Enter <code>docs[0]</code> in the console and see that that one article object is returned.  Enter <code>docs[0].snippet</code> to retrieve the value for that property.  
                </li>
                <li>
                     We can access any property by chaining the object references, using either the dot notation or the bracket notation.
                     <p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>If the property names in your data include spaces, you must use the bracket notation.</strong></p>
                     <code>docs[0].multimedia[1]["caption"]</code> returns the caption for the second image for this article.
                     <br> How would you access the value of the name property of the headline object of the second article in the array?
                </li>
             </ol>
             
             <h3>Part 2 - Adding properties to an object</h3> 
             <ol>
                 <li>We can easily add properties to an object using either the dot notation or the bracket notation.
                     Execute <code>docs[0].multimedia[1].color = "yellow"; docs[0].multimedia[1]["flavor"] = "chocolate"</code>, then explore that object to see that those properties have been added.  <p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>If the property names in your data include spaces, you must use the bracket notation.</strong></p>
                 </li>                 
                 <li>And of course, we can add properties with values that are complex objects.  Execute 
                     <code>docs[0].multimedia[1].meetingDays = ["Monday","Wednesday"];
                 </code>
                     How would access that second meeting day value?
                 </li>
                 
             </ol>
            <h3>Part 3 - Using $.each to loop through an object</h3> 
             <ol>
                 <li>The jQuery <strong>$.each()</strong> utility method (<a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/">http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/</a> lets us easily loop through objects and arrays.  Enter <code>$.each(docs)</code> in the console.  Note the error; $.each requires a second parameter, the callback function to be executed for each item in the array or object.
                 </li>
                 <li>$.each() exposes two values for us to use inside the callback function - the index position and the value at that position.  (If you're looping through and object, the two values are the property/key and value for that property/key.) This code includes a callback to log the snippet value for each document.
                     <pre>
                         $.each(docs, function (index, value) {
                             console.log(value.snippet);
                         });
                     </pre>
                     What will this do?
                     <pre>
                         $.each(docs, function (index, value) {
                             console.log(index);
                         });
                     </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write a loop to output the web url for each article.<br>
                </li>
                <li>When the item we're looping through is an object, the first parameter of the callback is the property/key name.  This code outputs the property names for each article.
                    <pre>
                        $.each(docs, function (index, value) {
                             console.log("article " + index + ": ****************************");
                             $.each(value, function (k,v){ 
                        		console.log(k);
                             })                   
                        });
                        
                    </pre></prep>
                    
                    
                    
                </li>
                
                 <li>
                    How would you output each of the image urls for each article? (After you try for a bit, mouse over the blank space at the bottom to copy/see one answer.)
                </li>
